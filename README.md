How It Works

1. The user types Markdown into a `<textarea>` on the left.
   MARKDOWN -> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain-text formatting to style documents.
It’s widely used on platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow to write content efficiently.

3. JavaScript captures the input and converts it using `marked()`.
4. The converted HTML is injected into the preview pane on the right, updating live.
